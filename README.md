# ML_Columbia
Online Machine Learning I (Grad/Master's Level) Course @ Columbia University.

This course provides an introduction to supervised and unsupervised techniques for machine learning. We will cover probabilistic and non-probabilistic approaches with learning activities such as lecture videos, quizzes, and coding projects.


## Academic Honesty Code
My projects are shared as documentation of my learning, not a repository for other students to plagiarize or copy. Therefore, the publishing of my works adheres to avoid violations against these codes:
1. Submitting work that is not original.
2. Submitting someone else’s work, or a modification of that work, with or without that person’s knowledge.
3. Allowing someone else to submit his/her work or a modification of that work.
4. Solving a quiz or project as a group. All coursework is to be done by the student working alone.
