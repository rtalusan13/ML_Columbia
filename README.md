Online Machine Learning I (Grad/Master's Level) Course @ Columbia University.


## My projects are shared as documentation of my learning, not a repository for other students to plagiarize or copy. Therefore, the publishing of my works adheres to avoid violations against these codes:
1. Submitting work that is not original.
2. Submiting someone else’s work, or a modification of that work, with or without that person’s knowledge.
3. Allowing someone else to submit his/her work or a modification of that work.
4. Solving as a group a quiz or project. All coursework is to be done by the student working alone.
